soulstealer
-> steals souls of enemies and makes their power his own?
    -> how to implement?
        -> maybe each enemy gets assigned a specific type and it gives the character buffs and nerfs based on it
            -> e.g.
                -> oni gives more dmg, but block is less OR it gives + strength and - dexterity on start (basic soul kind of)
        -> starter relic 
            ->will safe the last soul?
            ->lets user choose to override soul?
                ->could be unbalanced
            ->can more souls be contained?
                ->maybe possible to upgrade starter item to safe more souls or fuse souls?
            ->maybe souls are not unique and monsters just give souls as in a stacks
                ->cards can then do more based on stacks LAME AND TOO EASY late game?
                    ->the character has to be weakish early and more stronger late
                        ->maybe not, but why stack then anyways
        ->maybe cards can give certain buffs based on different souls?
        ->maybe get enemies as unplayable cards that are retained in hand and can be channeled by using cards in the deck?
        ->player could remove one card, so more cards would be needed to channel, maybe something like the stances on the mystic character

I like the idea.
